# "Hallucination" is a Security Vulnerability, Not a Bug

We use very soft language when we talk about AI. We say the model "drifted." We say it "confabulated." We say it "hallucinated."

These words make the problem sound like a quirk—a funny little hiccup in the user experience.

But as a Security Architect, I need to call this what it actually is: **A Data Integrity Violation.**

In the cybersecurity world, we live by the **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

- **Confidentiality:** We know how to encrypt data.    
- **Availability:** We know how to scale servers.    
- **Integrity:** This is where Generative AI is breaking our fundamental security model.    

### **When "Creative" Becomes "Corrupt"**

If a traditional SQL database returned a record that said you had $5,000 in your account when you actually had $500, we wouldn't call that a "database hallucination." We would call that a critical system failure. We would wake up the CISO.

But when an LLM summarizes a financial report and invents a revenue figure that doesn't exist, we shrug and say, _"Well, that's just the temperature setting."_

We cannot build enterprise-grade systems on top of "maybe."

If you are using AI for creative writing, a hallucination is a feature. If you are using AI for medical coding, legal discovery, or infrastructure config, a hallucination is a **vulnerability**. It is the corruption of trusted data.

### **The Architect’s Takeaway**

We need to stop treating output validation as a "nice to have" and start treating it as a security control.

1. **Enforce Grounding:** If the model cannot cite the specific source document for its claim (citation-based verification), the system should treat the output as "malicious" and block it.    
2. **Deterministic Guardrails:** Use code, not just prompts, to validate structured outputs. If the model is supposed to output JSON, use a parser to enforce the schema. If it fails, the user never sees it.    

"Hallucination" is a cute word for a dangerous problem. Let’s stop treating it like a dream and start treating it like a bug.
