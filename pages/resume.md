# Greg Surber, CISSP, CISM, Associate C|CISO
## Principal Cybersecurity Architect | OT Security & GRC | Kinetic AI Risk | CISSP CISM
_Billerica, MA | 253-951-5505 | info@gregsurber.com | linkedin.com/in/gregorysurber/_

## Professional Summary

Accomplished cybersecurity executive with 15+ years driving enterprise GRC solutions and quantitative risk management strategies across regulated industrial and commercial environments. Expert in aligning security posture with business objectives, managing risk in IT/OT convergence zones, and establishing governance frameworks. Deep expertise in translating complex regulatory requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, FISMA) into scalable, automated GRC solutions. Proven history building high-performing teams, enhancing third-party risk management (TPRM) programs, and driving measurable security improvements. Currently pioneering research into 'Kinetic AI Risk,' developing frameworks to secure the intersection of Agentic AI and Operational Technology (OT).

## Strategic Leadership Highlights

* **Audit Excellence:** Built enterprise security programs achieving consistent audit excellence across federal, utility, and commercial environments, serving as subject matter expert for FISMA, OIG, DoD STIG, and NERC CIP audits with zero findings.  
* **Policy & Framework Development:** Created the first DoDEA System Security Plan—a 375-page framework now used as the agency-wide template. Championed major regulatory transitions including leading a federal agency's transition from DoD C&A to Risk Management Framework (RMF).  
* **Third-Party Risk (TPRM):** Enhanced TPRM processes by standardizing security requirements in MSAs/SOWs with Legal, reducing vendor-related risk exposure.  
* **Security Culture:** Engineered security culture through enterprise-wide awareness initiatives for diverse audiences—from 6,000 educators to Master's-level cybersecurity students.  
* **IT/OT Convergence:** Led an Operational Technology (OT) Security Working Group for a critical infrastructure utility, coordinating security implementation between IT and industrial control systems (ICS)/SCADA teams.
